for my optical illusion, i used stripes. when i intitially made the blue stripes (theres also green lines there that are hard to see) i was seeing an optical illusion already without adding anything else. I think maybe because the stripes are so small, or maybe it has something to do with the color, but i was seeing the lines move in what looked like a diamond pattern. so to experiement with it a little more, i added a layer of geometric diamond shapes that change color in a very limited spectrum. it just makes the lines look a little more interesting, i think the lines look like they're moving once the geometric shapes fade to the barely noticable colors. 

i think if i were to use the optical illusion in the real world, i would use it for a website and turn the diamonds into one or many arrows to make it a transition page, where once the person clicks it goes to the next page. something about it feels kind of circus billboardy. think it could be added to a browser extention. it could also be interesting if the shapes were text instead, with like message you had to read.
