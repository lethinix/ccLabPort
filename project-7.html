        the missing clock - data portrait
    </h1>
   <P style = "color: rgb(90, 24, 57);">this iteration of the missing clock adds data into my
    original missing clock.
    this data portrait version uses an array of data - which consists of txt messages between
    my mom and i per day - and translates them as the distance between us as the user 
    clicks through. <br> the distance is plotted on a much more local scale to help the visuals, compared
    to the original missing clock. it's plotted on a range between the  most and least texts sent on any
    one day throughout the week. the day that the most texts were sent, the distance is the smallest
     and the visuals are slightly different. click through to see the week. 
   </P>
