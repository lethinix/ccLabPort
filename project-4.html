        the missing clock
    </h1>
   <p>the missing clock is an experimental clock made in p5js. it's meant 
    to re-measure time based on how much you miss someone. this clock measures 
    time based on a system of equations that uses the time you've known someone,
     the time you've spent away from them since you've known them, and the amount
    of time you've spent communicating digitally with them since you last left them. <br><br>
    time spent away moves the clock forward, and time spent communicating moves the clock back. </p>
