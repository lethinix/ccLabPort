        exquisite corpse
    </h1>
    <p>the exquisite corpse is a combination of the orion constellation, the moonflower, and the
         corpse bride. this is her story. 
         <br><br> 
         Star Flower was in love with Orion, the famous hunter. throughout her life, she wore beautiful,
          intricate flower dresses. one day, when she was wearing a moon flower dress, Orion noticed her 
          walking to get her flowers for the next day's dress. he fell in love instantly and they spent the 
          rest of their days together going out to fields and forests for Star Flower to gather flowers for
           the next day's dress while Orion hunted all the beasts on earth. Then one day, Gaia and Zeuse 
           decided that Orion need to be stopped, as they wanted the animals on earth to live in symbiosis 
           without his constant interferance and ego. They sent a scorpion to kill him and sent them both 
           to the stars. Star Flower decided to join him in the stars as well, because she did not want to
            live without Orion, and thought that her next era of dress design could incorporate stars with 
            her fabric instead of flowers. While she fell in love with being able to wear stars, she also
             kept her love of flowers, and still has moon flowers on her dresses today. Now, at night, the 
             moon flowers of the world look up at her to admire the combinations of stars and flowers she 
             presents to them each night.
