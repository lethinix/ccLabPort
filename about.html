    hello, my name is aisha kazembe. it is great to see you here. i am an engineer and artist.
     i currently attend parsons as a masters student in Design and Technology, graduated from 
     the university of southern california with a b.s. in environmental engineering, class of 
     2022. my work focuses on digital and physical messaging, sustainability, and fabrication 
     with a particular interest in dreams and experiences, and how these concepts interact with 
     sustainability and the built environment. i enjoy working with paint, natural resources, 
     digital systems, and sustainable building design, and have practical experience with 
     environmental data transformation and management and digital system design. in art, i am 
     focused on built and natural environments, people, and how they interact with each other.
    these interests amalgamate as i pursue a career in collaborative efforts to create built and 
    digital environments that interact harmonically with humans, the natural environment, and 
    the eye.</p>
